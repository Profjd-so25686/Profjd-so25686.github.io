I'm Ed Oyewo, an evolving Cybersecurity Professional. My primary focus is on Penetration Testing within the Cybersecurity field. I'm currently expanding my skills in Ethical Hacking using Kali Linux and pursuing my MSc in Cybersecurity. 

As I reflect on my extensive career, I am proud to have accumulated over 20 years of experience in the dynamic fields of IT and network management. My journey began with a deep dive into the intricacies of network infrastructure, where I honed my skills in managing, monitoring, and troubleshooting complex network environments. Over the years, I have witnessed and adapted to the rapid evolution of network technologies, from the early days of Ethernet networking to the current era of cloud-based and software-defined networks.
In my role as a network manager, I have been responsible for ensuring the uptime and performance of networks, a task that has become increasingly critical as businesses rely more heavily on data and connectivity. I have implemented various strategies to simplify network management, such as automating repetitive tasks and leveraging advanced tools, which has significantly reduced the operational costs and complexity associated with network maintenance.

However, in 2022, I embarked on a new chapter in my career by transitioning into the field of cybersecurity. This shift was driven by the growing importance of security in the digital landscape and my desire to expand my skill set to address the evolving threats that organizations face. My experience in network management has provided a solid foundation for understanding the vulnerabilities and risks associated with network security, allowing me to make a seamless transition into this critical area.
In addition to my technical expertise, I have also had the privilege of serving as an Education Manager with over 15 years of teaching experience in STEM fields. My approach to education is centered around being knowledgeable, approachable, and professional, ensuring that my students feel supported and motivated as they navigate their own career paths.

Throughout my career, I have been committed to staying updated with the latest trends and technologies. For instance, I am well-versed in the benefits of cloud-based network management, network-as-a-service (NaaS), and the integration of AI and automation in network monitoring and security.

My unique blend of technical expertise, educational experience, and professional demeanor has equipped me to handle a wide range of challenges in both IT and cybersecurity. I am dedicated to continuing my professional growth and contributing to the advancement of these fields, ensuring that organizations remain secure, efficient, and well-prepared for the future.
